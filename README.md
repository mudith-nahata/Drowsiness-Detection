# Inspiration
 According to the Association For Safe International Road Travel along with few other global surveys, there are more than 1.3 million accidents recorded every year, which implies every month on average more than 100,000 lives are lost. In-spite of major enhancements in technology, we still witness such casualties because of irresponsible driving such as being drowsy, distracted, drunk and many more. We identified the necessity of a cost-effective technological model which can prevent accidents and also be accessible from low to middle class sections of the society.
# What it does
  Our prototype is a creative, compact and cost-effective solution which can seamlessly prevent dangerous accidents in commute by intelligently alerting the driver in     lethargy and distraction and detection  using Computer Vision and also done some of the sample test of the System.

# How we built it
We have used a facial landmark detector to identify facial features in order to extract eye, which are the main identifiers for a driver to be lethargic and distracted respectively. A couple of major libraries namely dlib and open-cv in python are used to build our solution.
# Challenges we ran into
Distance between the upper and lower regions of eye is used as a parameter for assessing lethargy.Calculation of above statistical parameter that is distance, in order to get the eye-ratio  was a daunting task.
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have successfully accomplished the working prototype of our intention, along with nullifying the challenges we faced for parameters extraction without using any sensors.
# What we learned
We have explored the realms of computer vision and realized how the similar thought-process can be extended to other use-cases which could be very fruitful.
# Built With
 dlib numpy  opencv  python
